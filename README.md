Dumbux is a collection of chaotic, physics-based sandbox experiments and games that run directly in your browser. Embracing the "messy" side of creativity, it features raw, real-time interactions with custom physics engines, AI, and high-performance rendering.

The entire site is fully client-side:
- Built exclusively with HTML + JavaScript (and CSS).
- Powered by Three.js for WebGL/WebGPU rendering.
- No server-side code, no backend, no database.
- Instant loading – no downloads, no logins, no waiting.
- **No external game assets**: All geometries, materials, physics objects, and visuals are generated procedurally in code. No images, models, textures, or sounds are loaded from external files.

## Features
- A growing list of interactive experiments, including:
  - Shoot the Orbs (2D & 3D)
  - Crazy Drone
  - 3D Chess
  - Make a Mess Lab
  - Crazy Eagle
  - 3D Neon Race
  - DumbAI (with Minimax + Alpha-Beta pruning)
  - And many more physics-driven chaos like Merged Balls, Crazy Impulse, and Snipe The Bottles
- Realistic proprietary physics (elastic collisions, PID controllers for flight, etc.)
- Heuristic AI opponents
- Optimized for 60 FPS performance across mobile and desktop
- WebGPU-ready core for cutting-edge rendering

## How It Works
Each experience runs in the browser using a single HTML file structure. Three.js is loaded from a CDN, while everything else – from 3D scenes to physics calculations – is created programmatically with pure JavaScript.

## Contribute!
Create your own weird, experimental, or chaotic sandbox as a single HTML file and send it to `simuxcentre0@gmail.com`. If it fits the messy vibe, it might get featured on the site!

> "Send It" – Share your chaos! 🚀

Dumbux is an open playground pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the browser. Dive in and enjoy the mess!
